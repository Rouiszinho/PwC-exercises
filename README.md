# PwC code challenge 
My name is Luiz Henrique Almeida Ribeiro / Rouiszinho:v:

This project addresses the PwC code challenge, in this challenge we had a period of 6 days to carry out a series of exercises announced later.

In the Codes folder we have the files with the code belonging to each executable in the Executables folder, both having the same name, changing only the file type.

## Challenges
Each file aims at a statement congruent with the number present in the file, we can see the statement of each one below:

1. Reverse the order of the words in the sentences, keeping the order of the words
2. Remove all duplicate characters from the string below
3. Find the longest palindrome substring in the string below
4. Capitalize the first letter of each sentence in the string
5. Check if the string is an anagram of a palindrome 

Each file has its statement at the beginning of the commented code. Feel free to check them out :wink:

Note: It is possible that your security tool will alert you about unknown author. If so, proceed by allowing the program to run. :+1:
